Many city dwellers dream of fresh, homegrown fruit, but limited space and a lack of knowledge can be daunting obstacles. We recognize that some residents might not even realize the health benefits of cultivating their own fruit trees. Despite these challenges, there's a strong desire to bring a touch of nature and fresh produce into urban environments. This is why we've created UrFruits, a mobile app designed to empower city dwellers to get creative and cultivate fruit trees in their backyards or balconies.
